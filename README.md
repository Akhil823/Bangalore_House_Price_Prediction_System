# Bangalore_House_Price_Prediction_System
Made banglore house price prediction system. In this I have performed data cleaning such as handling null values, outlier removal. I have also performed dimensionality reduction. Then use one hot encoding to encode names of different locations. Then used pycaret to know which model gives us the best result. The best result was obtained from pycaret was bayesian ridge. Hence applied this model to predict price of a house in banglore city based on location, BHK and bathroom.
